# SFML Collision Game

Welcome to the SFML Collision Game! This project features a simple game implemented using the SFML library, where you control a red square that can move around the screen while avoiding a static blue square.

## Features

- **Two Squares**: One movable red square and one static blue square.
- **Movement**: Control the red square using the arrow keys.
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents the red square from passing through the blue square or moving outside the window boundaries.
- **Window Size**: The game window is sized at 1000x500.
